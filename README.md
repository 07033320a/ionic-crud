# Ionic USA!
*Ionic and Angular front-end with a Node, Express, Mongo back-end.*

<h2>Ionic Exploring</h2>
<p>Ionic is a powerful devkit utilizing HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, and Angular.js to build native-feeling mobile applications. It is more concerned with the look, feel, and interaction of the front-end over anything else.</p>
<p>The real power in Ionic comes from utilizing Cordova to run iOS and Android builds and deployments that allow for users to literally download from the App Store or Google Play straight to their phones. This greatly enhances the power of an otherwise basic web developer, allowing him or her to extend production reach.</p>
<p>The mobile app and native experience is supported via UIWebView. The main difference between Ionic and Angular.js is that Ionic is simply a UI toolkit and Angular.js is an application framework which Ionic utilizes.</p>

<h2>Start a Project</h2>
<p>If ionic hasn't been installed, yet you have npm, you're in luck! *npm install -g ionic* will get you set up.</p>
<p>A typical Ionic project starts with the command *ionic start myApp template* where myApp is the name of your app, and template is the tpye of setup you would like (various options include 'blank', 'tabs', and 'sidemenu'). Ionic will then populate all necessary build files and dependencies including cordova plugins.</p>
<h2>Add a Platform</h2>
<p>Ionic curently supports two main platforms for mobile development: iOS, and Android. To begin, for example, with iOS, tpye *ionic add platform ios* in the command line.
<h2>Build a Project</h2>
<p>To set up a build before running your application, *ionic build iOS* is the perfect command. Afterwards, you can perform *ionic serve* to display your application to the browser. To see it in a native view (with iOS & Android side-by-side) run *ionic serve --lab*</p>
