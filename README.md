Ionic/Angular front-end with a Node, Express, Mongo back-end.

<h2>Ionic Exploring</h2>
<p>Ionic is a powerful devkit utilizing HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, and Angular.js to build native-feeling mobile applications. It is more concerned with the look, feel, and interaction of the front-end over anything else.</p>
<p>The real power in Ionic comes from utilizing Cordova to run iOS and Android builds and deployments that allow for users to literally download from the App Store or Google Play straight to their phones. This greatly enhances the power of an otherwise basic web developer, allowing him or her to extend production reach.</p>
<p>The mobile app and native experience is supported via UIWebView. The main difference between Ionic and Angular.js is that Ionic is simply a UI toolkit and Angular.js is an application framework which Ionic utilizes.</p>
